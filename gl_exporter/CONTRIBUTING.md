## Cutting a Release branch
---

### 1. Prepare Version Bump PR
Update version references and open a PR:

**`lib/gl_exporter/version.rb`**
```ruby
- VERSION = "1.7.9".freeze
+ VERSION = "1.7.10".freeze
```

**`Gemfile.lock`**
```diff
- gl_exporter (1.7.9)
+ gl_exporter (1.7.10)
```

---

### 2. Create and Push Release Tag
After merging the version bump PR into `master`:

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git tag v1.7.10
git push origin v1.7.10
```

---

### 3. Publish Draft Release
1. Once the tag is pushed, go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/github/gl-exporter/releases).
2. Create a **new draft release** with the new tag, e.g. `v1.7.10`.
3. Add release notes (summary of changes).
4. Save as draft until functional test passes.

---

### 4. Run Functional Test
Verify the new version works against GitLab:

```bash
export GITLAB_API_ENDPOINT=https://gitlab.com/api/v4
export GITLAB_USERNAME=username
export GITLAB_API_PRIVATE_TOKEN=abc123
export GITLAB_NAMESPACE=
export GITLAB_PROJECT=repo1

versions=(v1.7.9 v1.7.10)

# Build Docker images
for version in "${versions[@]}"; do
  git checkout $version
  docker build --tag gl-exporter:$version .
done

# Run export with both versions
for version in "${versions[@]}"; do
  docker run --rm     --env GITLAB_API_ENDPOINT     --env GITLAB_USERNAME     --env GITLAB_API_PRIVATE_TOKEN     --volume $(pwd)/shared:/shared     gl-exporter:$version     gl_exporter --namespace $GITLAB_NAMESPACE --project $GITLAB_PROJECT     --out-file /shared/$GITLAB_PROJECT-$version.tar.gz
done

# Extract archives
for version in "${versions[@]}"; do
  mkdir shared/$GITLAB_PROJECT-$version
  tar -zxf shared/$GITLAB_PROJECT-$version.tar.gz -C shared/$GITLAB_PROJECT-$version
done

# Compare logs
diff -r shared/repo1-v1.7.9/log/gl-exporter.log shared/repo1-v1.7.10/log/gl-exporter.log
```

✅ Expected: Only timestamp differences in logs and JSON output.

---

### 5. Upload Release Artifacts
1. Package the tarball (`.tar.gz`) and zip (`.zip`).
2. Upload them to [Google Drive - GitLab Exporter](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/15K-FD7sKq0yMabFOMbj2y8IOFHBhxZRx).  
   Place them alongside previous versions.
---

### 6. Finalize Release
- Publish the GitHub release.
- Announce in the team channel with the release notes and link to the artifacts.
